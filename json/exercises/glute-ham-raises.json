  "overview": "are usually done on a machine, but you can reap the same strengthening benefits by pairing up with a partner who’s willing to hold your sweaty ankles. If your workout buddy is otherwise preoccupied, don’t fret. You can also do this exercise alone by wedging your toes firmly under a couch or coffee table. Have a heavy barbell lying around? You can tuck your ankles behind that, too.",
