  "overview": "For isolation exercises like the lateral raise, creating and maintaining tension is paramount. To do this properly, avoid using heavy weights. That doesn’t mean more weight is always a bad thing — but don’t slap on more pounds at the cost of losing tension. And nothing maintains tension like adding a pause in the contracted position.",
