  "overview": "The half-kneeling unilateral landmine press is a mix between a vertical and horizontal movement, which makes this great for people who lack the shoulder mobility for overhead pressing. Plus, if youâ€™re coming back from a shoulder injury, this is a great regression of the overhead press. ",
