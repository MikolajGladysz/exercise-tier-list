  "overview": "The chin-up is a bodyweight exercise that can induce serious muscle growth of the biceps (and back) with nothing but a pull-up bar. If you have a door-mounted pull-up bar in your home gym, then thatâ€™s all you need to bang out sets of chin-ups. Since the lifter pulls their own bodyweight, the biceps are usually exposed to loads heavier than one can lift with a barbell. However, lifters may often perform these incorrectly, engaging their shoulder and grip muscles.",
