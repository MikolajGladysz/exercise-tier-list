  "name": "Abs",
  "structure": "Abs is a paired straight muscle.[1] There are two parallel muscles, separated by a midline band of connective tissue called the linea alba",
  "function": "Abs is an important postural muscle. It is responsible for flexing the lumbar spine, as when doing a crunch. The rib cage is brought up to where the pelvis is when the pelvis is fixed, or the pelvis can be brought towards the rib cage (posterior pelvic tilt) when the rib cage is fixed, such as in a leg-hip raise. The two can also be brought together simultaneously when neither is fixed in space.",
