  "name": "shoulders",
  "structure": "The shoulder is one of the largest and most complex joints in the body. The shoulder joint is formed where the humerus (upper arm bone) fits into the scapula (shoulder blade), like a ball and socket. In workout we can devide sholder into three parts: <p><strong>anterior</strong></p><p><strong>acromial</strong></p><p><strong>spinal</strong></p>",
  "function": "The muscles and joints of the shoulder allow it to move through a remarkable range of motion, making it one of the most mobile joints in the human body. The shoulder can abduct, adduct, rotate, be raised in front of and behind the torso and move through a full 360Â° in the sagittal plane. This tremendous range of motion also makes the shoulder extremely unstable, far more prone to dislocation and injury than other joints.",
