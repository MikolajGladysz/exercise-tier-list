  "overview": "The landmine row has a lot in common with the barbell row, except the angle of your pull is slightly different. The landmine row, with the barbell anchored behind you, lets you get more of a squeeze with your lats. And because itâ€™s anchored, you cheat less and squeeze a little bit more.",
