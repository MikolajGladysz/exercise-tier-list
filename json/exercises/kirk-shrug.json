  "overview": "Kirk Karwoski started doing this shrug variation to increase grip strength for the deadlift. His coach, Marty Gallagher, thought this exercise would help him pull heavier â€” and Marty was right. Kirk pulled an 800-pound deadlift with the help of the Kirk Shrug. But they also discovered they built a bigger yoke too. By using a thumbless grip and a pause, this lift puts incredible tension on your upper traps which can cause serious injuy.",
