  "overview": "There are many variations of the overhead carry, but the standard-grip version allows for the heaviest load â€” and thus the highest stimulation. This exercise seriously challenges your upper traps, shoulders, core, and triceps isometrically, while also being a great accessory move to improve your overhead strength for presses and Olympic lifts.",
